## 1. Summary

This document describes an RPC method that provides node-relevant configuration data for the current, next, and last known forks.

## 2. Motivation

By providing an RPC method that allows clients to report key configuration variables before the next hard fork, operations teams can gain greater confidence that clients are correctly configured and prepared for upcoming forks.

### Target Audience and Use Cases

This method is intended for node operators, validator teams, and network monitoring tools to verify client readiness for upcoming forks. Use cases include:

- Automated pre-fork validation scripts comparing `eth_config` outputs across nodes.
- Manual checks by validator operators to ensure alignment with fork specifications.
- Debugging by client developers to identify configuration mismatches.
- Automated checks by Consensus Layer counterparties.

## 3. Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Clients MUST expose a new RPC method to report the current functional configuration and the expected next configuration via the standard JSON-RPC port.

Clients MAY also expose this method through the Engine API.

Clients MAY use these configuration objects to manage their per-fork configurations, though they SHOULD NOT simply return unprocessed configuration data.

When reporting the current, next and last configurations, clients MUST include every configuration parameter specified in this BEP.

Clients MUST return up-to-date configuration values, reflecting the most recent block header they provide. If clients cache the configuration, they MUST ensure such caches are purged when fork boundaries are crossed.

### Configuration RPC

A new JSON-RPC API, `eth_config`, is introduced. It takes no parameters and returns the result object specified in the next section.

### Result Object Structure

The RPC response contains three members: "current", "next", and "last". These members contain the configuration object currently in effect, the next configuration, and the last known configuration, respectively. "next" and "last" will be `null` if the client is not configured to support a future fork. "next" and "last" members will contain the same configuration in the case where the next configured fork is also the last configured fork.

### Members of the Configuration Object

Each configuration object MUST contain the following members, presented in alphabetical order. This RPC assumes the network is post-merge, and no accommodations are specified for proof-of-work-related issues.

Future forks may add, adjust, remove, or update members. The respective changes MUST be defined in either their BEPs or their respective meta-BEPs. Added members MUST be alphabetically sorted, so simply naming the new members is sufficient definition.

#### `activationTime`

The fork activation timestamp, represented as a JSON number in Unix epoch seconds (UTC). For the "current" configuration, this reflects the actual activation time; for "next" and "last", it is the scheduled time.

Activation time is required. If a fork is activated at genesis, the value `0` is used. If the fork is not scheduled to be activated or its activation time is unknown, it should not be in the RPC results.

#### `blobSchedule`

The blob configuration parameters for the specific fork, as defined in the genesis file. This is a JSON object with three members—`baseFeeUpdateFraction`, `max`, and `target`—all represented as JSON numbers.

#### `chainId`

The chain ID of the current network, presented as a string with an unsigned `0x`-prefixed hexadecimal number, with all leading zeros removed, in lower case. This specification does not support chains without a chain ID or with a chain ID of zero.

For purposes of canonicalization, this value must always be a string.

#### `forkId`

The `FORK_HASH` value as specified in [EIP-6122](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6122) of the specific fork, presented as an unsigned `0x`-prefixed hexadecimal number, with zeros left-padded to a four-byte length, in lower case.

#### `precompiles`

A representation of the active precompile contracts for the fork. If a precompiled contract is replaced by an on-chain contract—or removed—then it is not included.

This is a JSON object where the members are the agreed-upon names for each contract, typically specified in the BEP defining that contract, and the values are the 20-byte `0x`-prefixed hexadecimal addresses of the precompiles (with zeros preserved), in lower case.

#### `systemContracts`

A JSON object representing system-level contracts relevant to the fork, as introduced in their defining BEPs. Keys are the contract names (e.g., `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS`) from the first BEP where they appeared, sorted alphabetically. Values are 20-byte addresses in `0x`-prefixed hexadecimal form, with leading zeros preserved, in lower case. Omitted for forks before Cancun.

For Prague, the system contracts are (in order): `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS`.

## 4. Rationale

### Why Three Time Horizons?

Providing three configurations—current, next, and last—allows clients to:
- **current**: Immediately validate active fork parameters against operational expectations.
- **next**: Verify readiness for the immediately upcoming fork.
- **last**: Confirm long-term configuration alignment.

This approach balances operational needs (near-term validation) with strategic planning (long-term roadmap verification).

### Why Not Include All Future Forks?

Limiting the response to "next" and "last" reduces payload size and simplifies validation logic. Most operational issues arise from misconfiguration of the immediate next fork. Including all future forks would add complexity without proportional benefit, as far-future forks often lack finalized parameters.

### Standardization and Consistency

By mandating that all configuration parameters follow a consistent alphabetical ordering and naming convention, this method ensures:
- **Interoperability**: Different client implementations can be easily compared.
- **Predictability**: Tooling can parse responses without client-specific logic.
- **Extensibility**: New forks can add parameters without breaking existing parsers.

## 5. Backwards Compatibility

This BEP introduces a new RPC method without modifying existing ones. Clients that do not implement `eth_config` will simply not expose the endpoint, causing no disruption to existing infrastructure.

Monitoring tools and scripts should gracefully handle the absence of `eth_config` on older clients.

## 6. Test Cases

### With Future Fork Scheduled

An example request and response when a future fork (Prague) is configured:

```JSON
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_config",
  "params": []
}
```

Response:

```JSON

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Exposure Risks**: Incorrect configurations could leak operational details. Operators SHOULD restrict `eth_config` to trusted interfaces (e.g., local access or authenticated endpoints).
- **Dishonest Nodes**: Clients may report false configurations. Peers or monitoring tools MAY cross-check `eth_config` outputs against known fork specifications or other nodes' responses to detect anomalies.
- **DDoS Mitigation**: Clients MAY cache configuration objects internally and rate-limit `eth_config` requests to prevent resource exhaustion. Implementations MAY impose a minimum response interval (e.g., 1 second).
