## 1. Summary
To burn the BNB token of the 2 Nano exploiter address for security concern.

## 2. Motivation
The BSC exploiter has 2 EOA addresses which holds a very large amount of tokens which are exploited due to a BSC security vulnerability. These 2 addresses are blacklisted since Nano hard fork. But it still has potential risk that the blacklist mechanism could be broken, it would be much safer to burn the 2 addresses in advance.

## 3. Specification
At the begin of the hard fork block, transfer the 2 addresses' balance to an burn address. The 2 exploiter addresses are: `0x489A8756C18C0b8B24EC2a2b9FF3D4d447F79BEc` and `0xFd6042Df3D74ce9959922FeC559d7995F3933c55`. The burn address is: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead`
