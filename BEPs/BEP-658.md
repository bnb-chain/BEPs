</pre>


## 1. Summary

This Meta BEPs lists the BEPs formally Scheduled for Inclusion in the Osaka/Mendel network upgrade.

## Specification

The Mendel network upgrade comprises a total of 9 BEPs. Out of the 13 EIPs introduced in Ethereum's Fusaka scope, BSC has adopted 7 EIPs (6 requiring a hard fork and 1 as a client-side RPC update) while rejecting the remaining 6 EIPs due to architectural differences. Furthermore, the upgrade introduces two BSC-exclusive enhancements: BEP-657, which limits blob transaction inclusion by block number, and BEP-648, designed to reduce latency for Fast Finality.

### BEPs Scheduled for Inclusion

#### BEPs need hard fork

* [BEP-651](./BEP-651.md): Implement EIP-7823 Set upper bounds for MODEXP
    * follow the raw specification in [EIP-7823](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7823.md)
* [BEP-652](./BEP-652.md): Implement EIP-7825 Transaction Gas Limit Cap
    * follow the raw specification in [EIP-7825](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7825.md)
* [BEP-653](./BEP-653.md): Implement EIP-7883 ModExp Gas Cost Increase
    * follow the raw specification in [EIP-7883](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7883.md)
* [BEP-654](./BEP-654.md): Implement EIP-7939 Count Leading Zeros (CLZ) Opcode
    * follow the raw specification in [EIP-7939](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7939.md)
* [BEP-655](./BEP-655.md): Implement EIP-7934 RLP Execution Block Size Limit
    * there is no beacon client in BSC, so just limit RLP Execution Block Size to 8M to by following the raw specification in [EIP-7934](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7934.md)
* [BEP-657](./BEP-657.md): Limit Blob Transaction Inclusion by Block Number
    * BSC Only
* [BEP-659](./BEP-659.md): Implement EIP-7951 Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support
    * have implement by [BEP-381](./BEP-381.md) in BSC Haber hard fork, now change the gas cost by following the raw specification in [EIP-7951](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7951.md)


#### BEPs without hard fork

* [BEP-648](./BEP-648.md): Enhanced Fast Finality via In-Memory Voting Pool
    * BSC Only
* [BEP-656](./BEP-656.md): Implement EIP-7910: eth_config JSON-RPC Method
    * Client teams MUST support this JSON-RPC method by the activation of Osaka/Mendel network upgrade.

#### Rejected EIPs defined in [Fusaka](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7607.md)

* [EIP-7642](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7642.md): eth/69 - Drop pre-merge fields
    * eth/69 is not supported in BSC
* [EIP-7594](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7594.md): PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability Sampling
    * not need in BSC
* [EIP-7892](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7892.md): Blob Parameter Only Hardforks
    * not need in BSC
* [EIP-7917](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7917.md): Deterministic proposer lookahead
    * proposer in BSC is already deterministic
* [EIP-7918](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7918.md): Blob base fee bounded by execution cost
    * base fee in BSC is always 0
* [EIP-7935](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7935.md): Set default gas limit to 60M
    * not really need in BSC
