# Summary

**Summary/TL;DR**

This proposal outlines an initiative to implement a distributed (threshold) encrypted mempool for the Binance Chain, aimed at thwarting front-running and adding a robust layer of real-time censorship resistance. Motivated by the ethical vision of the BNB Good Will Alliance---which seeks to foster best practices and safeguard user interests---this proposal suggests that validators on Binance Chain can take a practical step by committing to include encrypted transactions in block proposals. These encrypted transactions are ordered and committed before decryption, ensuring that transaction details remain hidden until after the block is finalized, effectively eliminating the opportunity for front-running, as has already been demonstrated on the Gnosis Chain.

At a high level, the system allows users to submit transactions in an encrypted format while validators process them without decryption. Once the transaction order is locked in, the transactions are decrypted and executed using a distributed threshold encryption/decryption mechanism. The threshold decryption can be performed either by the Binance validators themselves or by a dedicated Shutter Keyper set, which is selected by a purpose-built DAO (Shutter DAO 0x36). This ensures that no single entity can control or manipulate the transaction order to their advantage or insert transactions with knowledge that they gained through unfair advantage.

On an implementation level, validators that will use the upcoming Erigon v3 client on Binance Chain are going to have the option to register for processing encrypted transactions. This process integrates this feature without disrupting the existing workflow. Erigon is actively developing a second client implementation for this specific purpose so that a version of Erigon v3 will be capable of processing encrypted transactions. The new release and feature will soon be available for BSC.Â 

Importantly, this mechanism is entirely opt-in: regular transactions will continue to be supported while users and RPCs gain the added choice of utilizing enhanced privacy features.

This proposal is a joint effort by brainbot GmbH, Erigon, and NodeReal, reflecting our collective commitment to advancing the Binance ecosystem and supporting its validator community. While we are excited about the potential of an encrypted mempool to enhance transaction fairness, improve censorship resistance, and deter malicious MEV activities, this document does not yet commit to specific assignments, milestones or resources. Detailed implementation tasks and deliverables will be defined in subsequent phases, ensuring that the transition is smooth and leverages existing technology already proven on networks like the Gnosis Chain.

## Motivation

### Community Trust and Ethical Standards

In recent years, challenges like front-running and sandwich attacks have eroded trust in blockchain transaction ordering. The BNB Good Will Alliance was established to address such challenges by driving off-chain best practices and ethical standards for the benefit of all ecosystem participants. This proposal is a natural extension of those efforts, ensuring that transaction ordering is transparent, secure, and fair.

### Mitigating Malicious MEV and Front-Running

Front-running exploits the order of transactions to yield undue profit, destabilizing market fairness. By committing to an encrypted mempool, validators secure transaction ordering by:

- **Pre-Decryption Ordering**: Locking in the order of transactions without exposure to plaintext data.

- **Decentralized Decryption Authority**: Requiring a threshold amount of parties to collaborate to perform decryption ensures that no single party can control or manipulate the transaction order for their own benefit or insert transactions using information obtained through unfair means.

- **Proven Technology**: Deployments on chains like Gnosis have showcased the effectiveness of such approaches in eliminating front-running.

### Ecosystem Growth and Long-Term Vision

Implementing this proposal will:

- **Enhance User Confidence**: A secure, censorship-resistant transaction order process will attract more users and developers.

- **Pave the Way for Advanced Integrations**: By aligning with the existing Proposer-Builder Separation supply chain standards and eventual Ethereum L1 integration, the encrypted mempool supports broader cross-chain innovations.

- **Mitigate Regulatory Risks**: By managing MEV responsibly, Binance Chain validators might be able to avoid regulatory classifications that might otherwise label validators or sequencers as financial intermediaries and require extensive monitoring/reporting of market abuse. See the latest ESMA regulation in this regard. The analogy here is that a provider of an end-to-end encrypted messaging provider can also not be held liable for malicious activity happening on its encrypted technical infrastructure.

### Real-Time Censorship Resistance and Builder Decentralization

Increasing centralization of block builders is a growing concern on blockchain platforms, notably on Ethereum, where centralized builder models can lead to real-time censorship and unfair transaction ordering. Although Binance Chain has not yet experienced severe centralization issues, this proposal proactively addresses potential future risks by:

- **Enhancing Censorship Resistance**: Encrypted transactions remain concealed until inclusion, preventing centralized actors from selectively censoring or reordering transactions based on their contents.

- **Reducing Builder Centralization**: By decentralizing both transaction ordering (which is already the case on BSC) and decryption through threshold encryption/decryption, the power to curate transactions is distributed among a broad set of validators or Keypers. This discourages the formation of centralized builder pools and mitigates any risk of undue influence over transaction inclusion.

- **Fostering Fairness**: A distributed and transparent ordering mechanism ensures that no single entity can dominate transaction sequencing, paving the way for a more equitable ecosystem.

## Specification

### Client Integration and Upgrade Path

Validators on the Binance Chain can opt-in to encrypted transaction processing by upgrading to the latest Erigon v3 client. Key aspects include:

- **Optional Registration**: Validators may register to support and include encrypted transactions while also continuing to process regular transactions.

- **Seamless Transition**: The protocol remains backward-compatible, enabling a gradual and safe transition process.

- **Multi-Client Support**: In addition to Erigon v3, similar support is anticipated from other clients like Nethermind, ensuring broad validator participation. Nethermind was the first client to support the encrypted mempool on the Gnosis Chain, so it is highly likely that it'll be trivial for them to support an implementation on BSC as well.

### Threshold Encryption Workflow

The heart of this proposal is the threshold encryption mechanism, which unfolds as follows:

1. **Transaction Submission:**

    Users encrypt transactions using a public key tied to the threshold committee, ensuring all submissions remain indistinguishable from one another.

2. **Validator Commitment:**

    Validators commit to including encrypted transactions in blocks while they are still encrypted. Each validator cryptographically commits to the transaction order.

3. **Decentralized Decryption:**

    Once a validator has committed to a bloc, a threshold decryption process is initiated. A committee---either composed of Binance validators or a dedicated Shutter Keyper set (managed by Shutter DAO 0x36)---collaborates to decrypt the transactions only when the required threshold is reached.

This workflow decentralizes trust, ensuring that even if a subset of participants is compromised, the encrypted contents remain secure.

### Integration with PBS and Cross-Chain Protocols

Drawing insights from proposals like[  The Road Towards a Distributed Encrypted Mempool on Ethereum](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-road-towards-a-distributed-encrypted-mempool-on-ethereum/21717), our design ensures future interoperability with an out-of-protocol PBS transaction supply chain as is used on the Ethereum mainnet.

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

Key threats addressed include:

- **Front-Running Attacks:**

    By locking in transaction order before decryption, the risk of manipulative reordering is eliminated.

- **Censorship Resistance:**

    The distributed decryption process prevents any single entity from censoring or reordering transactions.

- **Collusion:**

    Threshold encryption minimizes risks as an honest majority consensus is required for decryption.

### Cryptographic Assumptions

The proposal relies on:

- **Threshold Encryption Schemes:**

    Distributing the decryption key shares across multiple parties ensures no unilateral access.

- **Commitment Schemes:**
    Validators commit to a transaction order through cryptographic proofs.

- **Signature Verification:**

    All decryption-related messages are signed to guarantee authenticity and integrity.

## Performance, Latency, and Scalability

**Throughput:**

Overall throughput remains largely unaffected by the integration of encrypted transactions. This is due to the decryption process introducing minimal computational overhead and requiring minimal bandwidth resources. Importantly, no computation is performed over encrypted data---transactions are decrypted prior to execution---ensuring that block production and transaction processing rates remain on par with current operations.

**Latency:**

A slight increase in latency may be experienced for encrypted transactions. This is due to the additional step of waiting for inclusion in a Shutterized transaction slot. However, the impact on latency is expected to be minimal. As more validators opt-in to processing encrypted transactions, the probability of these transactions being included in a Shutterized slot increases, effectively reducing the latency in any potential transaction delays.

**Scalability:**

The minimal overhead of the decryption process ensures that the network's scalability is not compromised. Both standard and encrypted transactions can be processed in parallel, and the modular nature of the protocol allows for the seamless integration of additional validators or cryptographic accelerators if required.

## Call for Validators

## Deployment Roadmap and Next Steps

This proposal is a joint initiative by brainbot GmbH, Erigon, and NodeReal, reflecting our shared commitment to supporting the Binance and validator communities. While we are enthusiastic about advancing the implementation of an encrypted mempool on the Binance Chain, this document should not be interpreted as a formal commitment to specific assignments, milestones or resources at this stage. Detailed tasks and deliverables will be defined in subsequent phases of the project. Given that a similar system is already operational on the Gnosis Chain and that Erigon v3 will natively support encrypted transaction processing, the required implementation efforts are expected to be straightforward. Together, we look forward to collaborating with the broader community to enhance network fairness and security. An implementation plan could look like the following:

## Regulatory Implications

The evolving regulatory landscape presents significant challenges. Regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing entities that extract malicious MEV. In some jurisdictions, validators or sequencers involved in such activities could be categorized as financial intermediaries rather than purely technical operators. This categorization subjects them to stringent regulatory requirements, potentially complicating compliance and increasing operational risks. By proactively managing MEV through encrypted transaction ordering, the Binance Chain can:

- **Avoid Regulatory Reclassification**

    Maintain a status as a technical protocol rather than a financial intermediary.

- **Reduce Compliance Burdens**

    Mitigate the risk of strict regulatory oversight that could deter user adoption and inhibit growth.

- **Foster a Safer Ecosystem**

    Promote a compliant, fair, and transparent network that aligns with global regulatory expectations.

## Comparison of Technologies Enabling the Encrypted Mempool

Several cryptographic approaches have been proposed to enable encrypted mempools. Here we compare the primary technologies:

### 12.1 Timed Cryptography

Timed Cryptography, often implemented via Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), conceals transaction content until a predetermined time---typically when the transaction's block position is fixed. However, drawbacks include:

- **Specialized Hardware Requirements**

    Parties with specialized hardware may compute delays faster, risking premature decryption.

- **Resource Intensity**

    Delay functions are computationally expensive and potentially wasteful.

- **Network Inconsistencies**

    Variations in transaction reception times may lead to inequities.

- **Parameter Sensitivity**

    Setting the optimal difficulty parameter is challenging and critical.

- **Risk of Front-Running**

    If a transaction is not included in a block, its content may be revealed, enabling front-running.

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

FHE allows arbitrary computation over encrypted data, preserving confidentiality throughout processing. While promising for preventing malicious MEV and allowing beneficial backrunning:

- **High Computational Overhead**

    FHE currently imposes extreme computational constraints, making it impractical for real-time blockchain applications.

- **Efficiency Limitations**

    The cost in terms of processing power and latency remains prohibitive for current use cases.

### Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

TEEs, such as Intel SGX, offer a secure enclave for executing code even on compromised hosts. While TEEs can mitigate malicious MEV by ensuring secure transaction ordering:

- **Historical Vulnerabilities**

    Past attacks have raised concerns about the security guarantees of TEEs.

- **Trust Dependencies**

    Reliance on hardware manufacturers introduces centralized trust points, which can be problematic in decentralized environments.

### Witness Encryption

Witness encryption encrypts data under a particular statement, with decryption possible only if a valid witness is provided. For MEV protection:

- **Complexity of Relations**

    Constructing practical encryption schemes for conditions like "transaction included in a finalized block" remains a research challenge.

- **Limited Practical Use**

    Despite promising concepts, witness encryption is not yet viable for the dynamic requirements of blockchain transactions.

### Threshold Encryption

Threshold encryption splits the decryption key into shares and distributes those among multiple parties, requiring collaboration from a minimum amount to decrypt a message. Its benefits include:

- **Decentralization of Trust**

    No single party holds the complete decryption key, mitigating risks of premature decryption.

- **Timely Decryption Guarantees**

    With thresholds set appropriately, timely decryption is ensured even with adversarial activity.

- **Robust Security Assumptions**

    The system relies on the assumption that fewer than the threshold amount of parties behave maliciously---a trust assumption that can be further minimized through ongoing research.

In our view, threshold encryption is the most promising candidate for an encrypted mempool, providing a practical balance between security, efficiency, and decentralization.
