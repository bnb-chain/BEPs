## 1. Summary
After switching the validator set on the BSC chain, the previous block production record is still used to restrict some validators from producing blocks for the first few blocks after the switch, leading to brief network instability. This BEP aims to resolve this issue.

## 2. Motivation
The validator set on the BSC chain switches at each epoch.

Assume the number of validators in an epoch is validatorN. To ensure the consistency of the BSC chain, it is required that the chain must have at least validatorN/2+1 validators to continue advancing the chain.

To achieve this constraint, a set called MinerHistory is defined, with a length of validatorN/2, recording the validators that produced the last validatorN/2 blocks. New block-producing validators are required to not be in MinerHistory.

This BEP aims to enhance network stability by clearing MinerHistory when the validator set switches.

## 3. Status
This BEP is in progress.

## 4. Specification
In the previous specification, when the validator set switches at each epoch, MinerHistory is not cleared, causing some validators to be unable to produce blocks normally for the first few blocks after the switch.

</div>
This BEP clarifies that MinerHistory should be cleared when switching the validator set to solve this issue.

```Go
MinerHistory  map[uint64]Address  

if switching validator set for new epoch {
  MinerHistory = Address{}
}
```

## 5. Backwards Compatibility
There are no known backward compatibility issues.
