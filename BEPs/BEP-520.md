## 1. Summary
Shorten the block interval from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds to enable faster transaction confirmation and improve user experience.

## 2. Abstract
Since its inception, BSC has maintained a 3-second block interval. Shortening this interval can provide quicker transaction confirmations, enhancing user experience. However, this modification presents challenges that require adjustments to the consensus mechanism and network parameters.
There would be two phases to shorten block interval from 3 seconds to 0.75 seconds.
- Phase One: shorten block interval from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
- Phase Two: shorten block interval from 1.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds.

This BEP is mainly for phase one, but it will also include some description of phase two, as they are highly relevant.

## 3. Motivation
In a competitive blockchain landscape, users demand faster transaction confirmations. Reducing the block interval will make BSC more competitive and meet user expectations for high-performance blockchains.
And the two phases strategy is to avoid one big step to reduce it to 0.75s directly, which could be too risky, as the overall infrastructure may not be fully ready to this change. Phase two(0.75s) would be carried out after phase one(1.5s) has been verified.

## 4. Specification
### 4.1 Parlia Changes
#### 4.1.1 Millisecond Representation in Block Header
Before the implementation of this BEP, both block intervals and block times were represented with a minimum unit of `second`. Post - BEP, the minimum unit is changed to `millisecond`.

Regarding the representation of block time, to maintain maximum compatibility, the unit of `Header.Time` remains `second`. The `millisecond` component is stored in the last two bytes of `Header.MixDigest`. The following Go code snippets illustrate how this is achieved:
```Go
// SetMilliseconds can be called once millisecond representation supported
func (h *Header) SetMilliseconds(milliseconds uint64) {
	h.MixDigest = common.Hash(uint256.NewInt(milliseconds % 1000).Bytes32())
}

// Ensure Milliseconds is less than 1000 when verifying the block header
func (h *Header) MilliTimestamp() uint64 {
	milliseconds := uint64(0)
	if h.MixDigest != (common.Hash{}) {
		milliseconds = uint256.NewInt(0).SetBytes32(h.MixDigest[:]).Uint64()
	}
	return h.Time*1000 + milliseconds
}
```

#### 4.1.2 Penalize Intentional Delay Block Production and Increase `initialBackOffTime`
In the Parlia engine, each block height has a designated in-turn validator responsible for producing the block. If the in-turn validator fails to produce the block in time, a second-priority validator will take over after a delay equal to `initialBackOffTime`.
Current settings:
```Go
  blockInterval     = time.Duration(3000)*time.Millisecond
  initialBackOffTime= time.Duration(1000)*time.Millisecond
```
The in-turn validator can delay block production to just below `initialBackOffTime` without worrying about competition from the second-priority validator. As the block interval decreases, the proportion of production time that the in-turn validator can unfairly "steal" increases.

This behavior needs to be penalized. In a continuous block production scenario, such cases are easy to identify. The penalty mechanism reallocates all transaction fee rewards (except the portion that is burned) to the `SystemRewardContract`.

The detection condition is as follows:
```Go
func (p *Parlia) isBlockDelayMinedOnPurpose(header, parent *types.Header) {
	return header.Difficulty == diffInTurn && parent.Difficulty == diffInTurn &&
		header.Coinbase == parent.Coinbase &&
		parent.MilliTimestamp()+blockInterval < header.MilliTimestamp()
}
```

Given the above penalty mechanism, we can safely increase the initialBackOffTime to 2 seconds in order to reduce the likelihood of block reorganization:
```Go
  newBlockInterval     = time.Duration(1500)*time.Millisecond
  newInitialBackOffTime= time.Duration(2000)*time.Millisecond
```

### 4.2 Parameter Changes
As mentioned above, phase one and phase two are highly relevant, their parameter changes will be put in one table for easy comparison. But the parameters of phase two here is only for reference, as it could be changed in the future when phase two is finally delivered.

#### 4.2.1 Change table
A multitude of system parameters are configured based on the assumption that the default block interval is 3 seconds. Consequently, when the block interval is altered, these parameters must be adjusted accordingly:
|parameter |type |origin(3s)  | phase one(1.5s) | phase two(0.75s)|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|Epoch  |client parameter |200  |1000 |2000|
|GasLimit |client parameter |140M |60M |30M|
|GasLimitBoundDivisor |client parameter |256 |1024 |1024|
|Blob Target  |client parameter |3  |2  |1|
|Blob Maximum |client parameter |6  |3  |2|
|Blob MinBlocksForBlobRequests  |client parameter |524288 |1048576 (524288 × 2) |2097152 (524288 × 4)|
|BSCGovernor.votingDelay  |contract parameter |$votingDelay |$votingDelay × 2  |$votingDelay × 4|
|BSCGovernor.votingPeriod |contract parameter |$votingPeriod  |$votingPeriod × 2 |$votingPeriod × 4|
|BSCGovernor.minPeriodAfterQuorum |contract parameter |$minPeriodAfterQuorum  |$minPeriodAfterQuorum × 2 |$minPeriodAfterQuorum × 4 |
|BSCValidatorSet.misdemeanorThreshold |contract parameter |$misdemeanorThreshold  |$misdemeanorThreshold × 2 |$misdemeanorThreshold × 4|
|BSCValidatorSet.felonyThreshold  |contract parameter |$felonyThreshold  |$felonyThreshold × 2  |$felonyThreshold × 4|
|BSCValidatorSet.felonySlashScope |contract parameter |$felonySlashScope  |$felonySlashScope × 2 |$felonySlashScope × 4|
|BSCValidatorSet.TurnLength  |contract parameter |4  |16  |32|
## 5. Rational
### 5.1 Epoch and TurnLength
Within an epoch, some validators may fail to produce blocks as scheduled due to maintenance, system failures, or other issues. This can lead to an increased number of low-difficulty blocks, reducing network stability. When a new epoch begins, the validator set is adjusted, replacing validators that have repeatedly failed to produce blocks as scheduled to maintain network stability. Therefore, the epoch duration must not be too long, or the network’s stability will degrade.

Since validators now produce blocks consecutively, the epoch length should be set so that each validator has an approximately equal number of block production opportunities within an epoch.

At validator set transition points, a validator can deliberately delay broadcasting its block. As long as the delay does not exceed the predefined `initialBackOffTime`, the delayed block will still be accepted by the network. Increasing `BSCValidatorSet.TurnLength` effectively mitigates this issue.

Considering these factors, the epoch length is set to 2000, and `TurnLength` to 32. When the block interval is ultimately reduced to 0.75 seconds, the epoch duration will increase from 600 to 1500 seconds. A 2000-block epoch roughly allows 21 validators to produce three full rounds of 32 blocks each.

### 5.2 GasLimit and GasLimitBoundDivisor
As the block interval shortens, the gas limit per block must decrease accordingly. However, since not all time within a block interval is used for transaction processing, the gas limit is reduced slightly more than the proportional decrease in block interval. The gas limit is initially set to decrease to 60M in the phase one hard fork and to 30M in phase two hard fork.

GasLimitBoundDivisor represents the rate of change in GasLimit. Since the block interval will be reduced by a factor of four after phase two, GasLimitBoundDivisor is increased by the same factor to maintain a consistent rate of GasLimit adjustment to avoid sharp gas limit fluctuation if some validators use a too small or too large gas limit value.

As GasLimit is not part of consensus, it is calculated based on validators' configuration. So need validators's support to downgrade their gas limit configuration before each hard fork.

### 5.3 Blob Related
This BEP implementation aims to maintain or enhance the network’s capacity to handle blobs. According to the table, before phase one hard fork, the network handles a target of 1 blob per second (3 blobs/3 seconds). After phase one hard fork, it will be 4/3 blobs per second(2 blobs/1.5seconds). So there will be ~33% improvement in blob processing capacity.

### 5.4 Contract Parameters
The seven parameters—`BSCGovernor.votingDelay`, `BSCGovernor.votingPeriod`, `BSCGovernor.minPeriodAfterQuorum`, `BSCValidatorSet.misdemeanorThreshold`, `BSCValidatorSet.felonyThreshold`, `BSCValidatorSet.felonySlashScope`, and `Blob MinBlocksForBlobRequests`—are all measured in block numbers and used to calculate time. Therefore, when the block interval is reduced, the block numbers must be increased proportionally to maintain the same time representation.

## 6. Backward Compatibility
### 6.1 MEV
After phase one, the block interval will be reduced to 1.5 seconds, a single validator will produce 16 consecutive blocks per turn, keeping the total block production time at 24 seconds (1.5 × 16). However, the shorter block time significantly reduces the collaboration window for searchers, builders, and validators, impacting the current process and requiring adjustments.

### 6.2 Layer 2 Solutions
The usage of blob transaction will be changed, as blob target will be decreased from 3 to 2 and blob maximum will be decreased from 6 to 3. Layer 2 can only attach 3 blobs at most for each transaction and the blob gas price calculation mechanism will also be slightly different.

### 6.3 Quarterly Auto-Burn
The [Quarterly Auto-Burn](https://www.bnbburn.info/) mechanism also requires adjustment,The block count in the formula is replaced with time, resulting in the new formula:
<div align="center">
<img src=./assets/bep-520/5-3.png width=60% />
</div>
where T represents the number of seconds in the corresponding quarter.

### 6.4 Block Finality
This BEP will not change the fast finality mechanism, but short block interval could bring some challenges to fast finality, as votes need to be propagated in a shorter time. When fast finality works properly, with this BEP, the average transaction finality time would be reduced from 7.5 seconds to 3.75 seconds.
But if fast finality failed, with TurnLength 16 and ValidatorSize 21, for natural block finality, it will be:
- (with >1/2 validator confirmations):  176(11*16) blocks, that is 264 seconds
- (with >2/3 validator confirmations):  240(15*16) blocks, that is 360 seconds
