## 1. Summary

This BEP attempts to enhance the network stability by delay the first off-turn block generation, so the in-turn block could have more time to be propagated.

## 2. Motivation

The current Parlia consensus mechanism involves a primary in-turn validator responsible for producing each block, with several off-turn validators on standby to take over in the event of a failure by the in-turn validator. These off-turn validators adhere to a strict backoff timing protocol for block production. The current initial backup time is set at 1 second, which imposes a stringent demand on network latency. If a block is not delivered within this timeframe, the first off-turn validator is triggered to produce and broadcast an alternative block. Given the often unpredictable nature of network conditions, it's not unusual for off-turn blocks to be generated due to network fluctuations. These unexpected off-turn blocks can disrupt the network and negatively affect the performance of the blockchain.

By extending the initial backoff time to 2 seconds, such instabilities can be significantly reduced. Doubling the network latency window from 1 to 2 seconds provides a buffer that can help mitigate the impact of network jitter, thereby enhancing the overall stability and performance of the blockchain.

## 3. Specification

Under this proposed BEP, the first off-turn validator will have the capacity to produce a block at a time calculated as `ParentTimestamp + 3 + 2`. Subsequent off-turn validators will follow with a one-second interval between their block production times.

To illustrate this with an example, consider a scenario where there are 21 validators in the network. If the timestamp of the previous block is `1000`, the in-turn validator will be permitted to broadcast a new block starting from `1003`. In the event that the in-turn validator does not produce a block within their designated time, there are `10` off-turn validators ready to step in as backups. These off-turn validators have staggered backup times, increasing sequentially: `1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014`. This arrangement ensures a smooth transition and continuity in block production, reducing the likelihood of network disruption due to untimely block deliveries.
