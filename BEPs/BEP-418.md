## 1. Summary

This BEP attempts to enhance the network stability by delay the first off-turn block generation, so the in-turn block could have more time to be propagated.

## 2. Motivation

According the current Parlia consensus, there is one in-turn validator and several off-turn validators for each block. The in-turn validator has the highest priority to produce, and the off-turn validators act as backup to produce block in case the in-turn validator failed to do it. And these off-turn validators follow a strict backoff time rule to produce blocks. Currently the initial backup time is 1 second, which put high requirement on the network latency, if the block failed to be delivered within 1 second, then the first off-turn validator will produce and broadcast an off-turn block. Since the complicated the network environment, it is common to observe these off-turn blocks due to network jitter. This kinds of unexpected off-turn blocks could disturb the network and impact the chain performance.
By increasing the initial back off time to 2 seconds, this kind of instability could be greatly mitigated, as the network latency would be double from 1 second to 2 seconds.

## 3. Specification

With this BEP, the first off-turn validator will be able to produce block at `ParentTimestamp + 3 + 2`, and the follow off-turn validators would produce blocks have 1 second internal. Let's take an example, suppose there are 21 validator, the previous block's timestamp is: `1000`, then the in-turn validator is allowed to broadcast block after `1003`, and there will be `10` off-turn validators, if they failed to receive block before their backoff time, they can act as a backup to produce the off-turn block, they have different backup time, with an ascending order: `1005,1006,1007,1008,1009,1010,1011,1012,1013,1014`.
