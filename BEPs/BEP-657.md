## 1. Summary

This BEP restricts blob transaction inclusion to blocks where the block number modulo 10 equals zero (i.e., blocks ending in 0). This provides DoS mitigation while maintaining predictable blob transaction inclusion.

## 2. Motivation

Blob transactions provide a cost-effective way to store data on-chain, which is beneficial for Layer 2 solutions and other applications requiring data availability. However, this cost-effectiveness can also be exploited for network abuse.

Without appropriate rate limiting, the network faces several risks:

1. **Network Bandwidth Strain**: Excessive blob data propagation could saturate network bandwidth, affecting overall network performance.

2. **Validation Performance**: High volumes of blob transactions increase computational burden on validators, potentially impacting block validation times.

3. **Storage Resource Pressure**: Nodes must retain blob data for a retention period, and unrestricted blob inclusion could create unsustainable storage requirements for node operators.

By introducing a predictable, time-based restriction on blob transaction inclusion, this BEP aims to:

- **Rate Limiting**: Establish a natural rate limit on blob transactions to prevent abuse
- **Sustainability**: Ensure long-term viability of node operations by managing resource requirements
- **Network Stability**: Prevent sudden load spikes that could impact network performance

The modulo 10 restriction provides a simple, deterministic rule that balances legitimate use cases with network protection.

## 3. Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

For any block with block number `N`:
- If `N % 10 == 0`: The block MAY contain blob transactions
- If `N % 10 != 0`: The block MUST NOT contain any blob transactions

Blocks violating this rule MUST be rejected as invalid.

## 4. Rationale

The modulo 10 restriction (one in every 10 blocks) balances DoS protection with usability:

* **Attack Mitigation**: Reduces blob transaction capacity to 10% of potential maximum, making sustained DoS attacks significantly more expensive.
* **User Impact**: With BSC's 0.45-second block time, maximum inclusion delay is only 4.05 seconds. For L2 sequencers posting data every 30-60 seconds, this represents minimal additional latency.
* **Resource Management**: Reduces storage requirements by 90% and distributes network resource utilization more evenly, making full node operation more sustainable.

## 5. Backward Compatibility

This is a consensus-breaking change that requires a hard fork. All validators must upgrade to enforce the new validation rule.

* **L2 Sequencers**: Must adjust data availability posting schedules to target eligible blocks. Maximum additional delay is 4.05 seconds.
* **MEV Builders**: Blob-related MEV opportunities will be concentrated in eligible blocks (every 10th block).
