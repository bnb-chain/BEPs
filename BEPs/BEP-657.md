## 1. Summary

This BEP restricts blob transaction inclusion to blocks where the block number modulo 10 equals zero (i.e., blocks ending in 0). Non-eligible blocks preserve blob fee state from their parent to maintain market continuity.

## 2. Motivation

BSC's block time has been reduced from 3 seconds to 0.45 seconds, yet blob transaction volume has remained relatively constant at approximately one per 7-8 blocks. This mismatch has resulted in severe blob space oversupply.

**Blob Fee Market Dysfunction**: The ~6.7x increase in blob capacity with unchanged demand has caused the blob base fee to consistently remain at its minimum floor price. This prevents the EIP-4844 fee market mechanism from functioning properly, as it relies on supply-demand dynamics for price discovery.

By restricting blob transactions to every 10th block (blocks where `N % 10 == 0`), this BEP concentrates demand to restore proper fee market dynamics while maintaining adequate capacity for current usage patterns. With 0.45s block times, the maximum inclusion delay of 4.05 seconds has minimal impact on L2 operations.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Blob Transaction Inclusion Rules

For any block with block number `N`:
- If `N % 10 == 0`: The block MAY contain blob transactions
- If `N % 10 != 0`: The block MUST NOT contain any blob transactions

Blocks violating this rule MUST be rejected as invalid.

### 3.2 Blob Fee Calculation Modification

**For blocks where `N % 10 == 1`:**
- Normal EIP-4844 blob fee calculation applies

**For blocks where `N % 10 != 1`:**
- `header.ExcessBlobGas` MUST equal `parent.ExcessBlobGas`

This ensures the blob fee is calculated once after each eligible block, then preserved across subsequent blocks until the next calculation.

## 4. Rationale

The modulo 10 restriction (1 in every 10 blocks) aligns with current demand patterns:

* **Fee Market Alignment**: Current usage (~1 blob tx per 7-8 blocks) naturally fits within the 1-in-10 schedule, enabling proper EIP-4844 fee mechanism operation.
* **Minimal User Impact**: With 0.45s block time, maximum inclusion delay is 4.05 seconds, negligible for L2 sequencers posting data every 30-60 seconds.
* **Fee Continuity**: Non-eligible blocks inherit blob fee state from their parent, preserving market state across the 9-block gap and enabling proper price discovery at the next eligible block.

## 5. Backward Compatibility

This is a consensus-breaking change requiring a hard fork. All validators and full nodes must upgrade before activation.

Transaction submitters must ensure blob transactions target eligible blocks (blocks where `N % 10 == 0`). Blob-related MEV opportunities will concentrate in these eligible blocks.
