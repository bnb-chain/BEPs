## 1. Summary
Add a network layer, which accept validator or validator authorized node to join in to improve the network efficiency and reduce network latency between validators.

## 2. Motivation
Low latency is one of the key user experience and if BSC wanna to support shorter block interval, network latency between validators could be crucial to support sub-second block interval. Current P2P gossip based network is good at broadcasting blocks/transactions to the whole network, but it is not efficient enough, i.e. it would take lots network bandwidth and also cost non-negligible latency. Validators are the key player to sustain the network, so one validator dedicated network layer could help to address the two issues.

## 3. Specification
### 3.1.Validator Dedicated Network(VDN)
The general network layout is described in the bellow diagram, basically validators would be able to be connected directly, so the latency can be reduced. 

There would be some new roles in VDN:
- Validatot BootNode: it is help validators to discover each other and establish the connection
- Validator-RPC-Sentry: transactions can be sent to this sentry node and it will forward it to the corresponding validator nodes.
- Validator-Proxy: in is optional, in case validator donâ€™t wanna expose itself to public network, it could authoerise one or more proxy nodes to connect to the VDN.

### 3.2.Directional Transactions Broadcast
It is another key aspect of VDN, transactions that are broadcasted in VDN would no long gossip based, on the opposite, they will only be broadcasted to nextN validators which have the right to propose next block.

## 4. Backwards Compatibility
TBD
