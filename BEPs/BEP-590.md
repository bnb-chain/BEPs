## 1. Summary

This BEP proposes an extension to the aggregate vote inclusion rules in the Fast Finality (FF) protocol of the BNB Smart Chain. The change aims to improve the stability and liveness of Fast Finality under adverse network conditions and support further reductions in block interval.

## 2. Abstract

[BEP-126](./BEP126.md) introduced Fast Finality as a mechanism for deterministic block finalization in BNB Smart Chain. Under the original design:

* Proposers (miners) may only aggregate votes for their direct parent block.

Formally, if `KAncestorGenerationDepth` defines the inclusion scope, then in the original design:

```
KAncestorGenerationDepth = 1
```

This BEP extends the scope by allowing `KAncestorGenerationDepth > 1`:

* **Aggregate Vote Inclusion Extension** — Proposers may include votes for up to `KAncestorGenerationDepth` recent ancestor blocks, improving tolerance to vote propagation latency.

This adjustment enhances the resilience of Fast Finality during periods of network congestion, without modifying the core consensus model or cryptographic assumptions.

## 3. Motivation

Validators can experience latency in receiving, verifying, and casting votes for blocks. Such delays may lead to missing justifications, which in turn hinders finalization.

Additionally, as block intervals shorten, inter-region network latency becomes a more prominent bottleneck in vote propagation.

This BEP addresses these issues by introducing:

* **More flexible vote aggregation** — to increase the chances of including valid votes despite network delays.

## 4. Specification

This BEP introduces modifications to the **Aggregate Vote Inclusion Rules**.

### 4.1 Aggregate Vote Rule Changes

To improve vote inclusion under delayed network conditions, proposers are allowed to aggregate votes for recent ancestor blocks. The process follows this priority sequence:

1. Attempt to aggregate votes for the **immediate parent block**.
2. If unavailable, try the **grandparent block**.
3. Continue iteratively up to `KAncestorGenerationDepth` recent ancestors.

The process **terminates immediately** once any valid vote is included. At most **one ancestor block’s votes** may be aggregated in a single proposal.

This rule gives validators up to `KAncestorGenerationDepth` block intervals to propagate their votes, improving the success rate of vote inclusion and reducing justification gaps during periods of network latency.

With [the block interval reduced to 0.45s](./BEP-619.md), the parameter `KAncestorGenerationDepth` is set to 2.
```
  KAncestorGenerationDepth = 2
```

## 5. Security

This BEP does **not** alter the core safety assumptions or mechanisms of Fast Finality defined in [BEP-126](./BEP126.md). Specifically, it **does not change**:

* **Validator Vote Rules** — which govern when and how validators may issue votes.
* **Finality Rules** — including thresholds for justification and finalization.
* **Longest Chain Rule** — the fork-choice rule determining canonical chain selection.

This proposal only modifies the **vote aggregation scope** to improve vote inclusion flexibility.
All original safety guarantees, including one-block finality under an honest super majority, remain **intact**.

## 6. Backward Compatibility

This BEP is **not backward compatible** with older clients, as it changes vote aggregation behavior. However, it introduces no changes to protocol-level message formats or user-facing APIs.

A full client upgrade across validators and block producers is required to activate the changes and maintain consensus.
