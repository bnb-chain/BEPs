## 1. Summary

This BEP introduces a new precompiled contract to validate the [CometBFT](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/introduction/) light blocks.

## 2. Motivation

There are some cross-chain requirements between BSC and CometBFT-compatible blockchains, thus we need a gas-friendly
solution to validate the light blocks from the CometBFT-compatible blockchains.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Consensus State

To validate the light blocks from the CometBFT-compatible blockchains, there should be a light client of the blockchain
on the BSC side, it could be implemented as a smart contract, and this light client should record the necessary
current state which we call it **Consensus State** to validate the future light blocks. The consensus state is defined as:

```go
type ConsensusState struct {
  ChainID              string
  Height               uint64
  NextValidatorSetHash []byte
  ValidatorSet         *types.ValidatorSet
}
```

The consensus state should be encoded as a part of the precompiled contract's input, and after applying the light block,
the updated consensus state should be encoded as a part of the precompiled contract's output. The encoding format should be:
```
|--ChainID---|--Height---|--NextValidatorSetHash--|--[{validator pubkey, voting power, relayer address, relayer bls pubkey}]--|
|--32 bytes--|--8 bytes--|--32 bytes--------------|--[{32 bytes, 8 bytes, 20 bytes, 48 bytes}]--------------------------------|
```

The `validator pubkey` and `voting power` are necessary for recovering the validator in the current validator set. The
`relayer address` and `relayer bls pubkey` are extended to support some cross-chain infrastructure base on [BLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature),
we can just pad zero bytes if we don't use `relayer address` or `relayer bls pubkey`.

### 3.2 Light Block

A light block of CometBFT-compatible blockchain contains a SignedHeader and a ValidatorSet, which can be imported into
the [CometBFT Light Client](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/light-client/) and update the light client's consensus state accordingly. The light block is defined as:

```go
type LightBlock struct {
   *SignedHeader `json:"signed_header"`
   ValidatorSet  *ValidatorSet `json:"validator_set"`
}
```

The light block itself has a **Marshal** method to convert it into a byte array, and it should be a part of the precompiled
contract's input. Within the precompiled contract, use the **Unmarshal** method to recover it.

### 3.3 Validate Light Block

The input of the precompiled contract should include the current consensus state and the future light block. The encoding
format should be:
```
|--consensus state length--|--consensus state--|--light block--|
|--32 bytes----------------|-------------------|---------------|
```

Here are the steps to validate the light block within the precompiled contract:
1. Decode the input to get the current consensus state and the light block.
2. Apply the light block into the current consensus state according to [CometBFT Light Client Verification](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/light-client/verification/).
3. Encode the updated consensus state and return it to the caller.

The output of the precompiled contract should be encoded as follows:
```
|--validatorSetChanged--|--empty-----|--consensus state length--|--new consensus state--|
|--1 byte---------------|--23 bytes--|--8 bytes-----------------|-----------------------|
```
